    long: `I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for building intelligent, resilient systems. 
Currently pursuing my MS in Computer Science at Northeastern University, I specialize in:

  → Machine Learning & Deep Learning
  → Full-Stack Development  
  → Cloud-Native Architectures
  → Autonomous & Multi-Agent Systems

My recent work includes building crash-resilient AI systems, RAG platforms for enterprise use, 
and real-time applications with sub-200ms response times.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me on the badminton court competing in Bay Area tournaments,
capturing moments through photography, or exploring new places.`
